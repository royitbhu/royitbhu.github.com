Here is a list of different projects that I have completed or working on..

<b>1. Wavelet and PDE based approach for Image and Video Scaling and De-noising</b> 
Github link :	[https://github.com/the-codebreaker/Scaling-and-denosing]
Technologies Used : OpenCV , Matlab ,C++<br>

	  Implemented various scaling algorithms like bilinear, nearestneighbor , bicubic , and lanczos (sinc 3) with both static as well as dynamic (from video) images for different resolutions, and also applied Wavelet and PDE based methods to de-noise the resultant images and compare various results using different parameters(PSNR , MSE , CP , MSSIM ).


<b>2. Edge Detection</b>
Github Link : [https://github.com/the-codebreaker/Edge-detection]
Technologies Used : OpenCV , Matlab ,C++

	Edges of objects has been detected is four Steps
	 Step 1: Apply a Gaussian blur
	 Step 2: Find edge Gradient strength and direction
	 Step 3: Trace along the edges
	 Step 4: Non-maximum Suppression


<b>3. Task Scheduling Algorithms for Heterogeneous Computing System</b>
Github Link : [https://github.com/the-codebreaker/HEFT-Task-Scheduling]
Skills Acquired : Distributed Computing , Parallel Computing , Random Graph generation

	  Implemented a new approach involving Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time First (HEFT) algorithm using duplication. Random graph generator was implemented to compare the efficiency of the algorithms



<b>4. Class Scheduling using Genetic Algorithms</b>
Github Link : [https://github.com/the-codebreaker/Class-scheduling-genetic-algo]
Technologies Used : Java , GUI programming
	
	  Based on the given data set of no. of students, professors and other data, a class schedule is to be designed which satisfies certain constraints. It is a high dimensional, multi-constraint  combinational optimization problem . A new algorithm which incorporates Branch and Bound algorithm in Genetic algorithm was devised to solve the problem.

5. <b>Dynamic Task Scheduling with Load Balancing Using Genetic Algorithm</b> (Ongoing) [Mtech  Project]
Github Link : [https://github.com/the-codebreaker/Dynamic-Load-Balancing]

Skills required:  Genetic Algorithn ,Task scheduling,Parallel Computing,Load Balancing
